IMPORTANT NOTE: this app does ask you to provide your location when first launched, but that location is not at all used. It just has to be enable in order to be able to scan for bluetooth devices. 

ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: After further testing, it seems that this app only works for certain types of android devices based on the way diffrent devices handle bluetooth. I can't gurantee that It'll work on all types of devices.
